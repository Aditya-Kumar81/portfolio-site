# Hi there

My name is Aditya and I'm bad at Valorant. I've reaches Silver3 in episode 9 ACT III.

We all know how hard is to play valorant in a 5 stack as lot of smurfs come on the opposing stack and thats tough.

"I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks."
â€” Walter White

we werent the team who suffered. we were the one with the smurf.

valorant is also interesting because it has an kernel level anti cheat protection which has been very succesful till now.
**But**
the issue with this is that the same kernel level anticheat can access everything on your computer, compromising privacy.
and battelfield 6 brought this into the light for non technical crowd.
